Let's Shop is a collaborative effort to create custom backends for the Nintendo eShop (3DS only currently) in Python, before it's death in March 2023.

## Info

This project is a rewrite in Python from the ReShop project, available <a href="https://github.com/ReShop-3ds">here</a>.

It will feature a majority of eShop's servers (except the account server) such as title CDN, Ninja server, and all sorts of SOAP servers, to be able to be offcial eShop-free.

There is also title installation planned, because I think everybody agrees that just browsing an online shop without downloading anything is a bit... sad.

All of that... in 5 months, as I write this (3rd of November of 2022).*

Stay tuned! :sparkles:
